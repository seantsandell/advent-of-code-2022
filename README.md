# Advent of Code 2022

This repo hosts my attempts at answering the puzzles contained in 2022's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) project.

## About AoC

*Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.*
